        <p>
            Welcome to the Rochester High School Robotics website. The RHS Robotics club is a student led organization
            that allows students to compete in the SkillsUSA Urban Search and Rescue competition.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p> 
            The objective of the competition is for a two-member team to build a robot and arm mechanism prior to the competition and then, during the
            competition, remotely operate the robot, which should be capable of locating, grabbing, and moving
            simulated ordnances on the challenge course. This remotely operated vehicle (ROV) must traverse the
            course, locate the ordnances, secure them, and properly dispose of them. Each team will perform one
            round of competition consisting of a time-limited mission to locate and dispose of the two ordnances
